# Resume-Classification-System
AI-powered resume classification system can accurately and efficiently analyze resumes, extract relevant information, and categorize them into predefined categories or job roles.
<br>
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The process of reviewing and evaluating resumes for job applications is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. The task becomes even more complex when organizations receive an overwhelming number of applications. To address these challenges, the problem at hand is to develop an AI-powered resume classification system that can accurately and efficiently analyze resumes, extract relevant information, and categorize them into predefined categories or job roles.

### Using one hot encoders technique
The purpose of one-hot encoding is to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, enabling machine learning algorithms to effectively interpret and utilize these variables.

## DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that builds a tree-like model to make predictions based on a set of input features.

## RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER

A random forest algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees, each of which is based on a random subset of the data.<br>

## Model Evaluation/Performance

By using decision tree classifier accuracy is 0.5<br>
Random Forest Classifier gives accuracy 0.29 with random state 7<br>
XGB Classifier gives accuracy 0.39<br>
KNN Classifier gives accuracy 0.33<br>

So Decision Tree classifier gives highest accuracy 0.5.<br>
